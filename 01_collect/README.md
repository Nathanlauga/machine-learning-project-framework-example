# 01_collect

In this section your main goal is to collect data, describe what you can find in it, maybe how you get the data and save the informations into a file named `data_informations.csv` which is available in this directory.

To can store the data into the `/_data` directory so that it'll be easiest to understand the project for a new developper.

**/!\ I recommend that you store only raw data in this section /!\\**
